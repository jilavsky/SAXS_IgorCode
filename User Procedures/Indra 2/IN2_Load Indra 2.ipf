//	These macros allow evaluation of data obatined on Bonse-Hartman camera at 9ID beamline at APS
//	The data are collected through spec program.
//	Report any bugs promptly to me, I'll try to fix them ASAP
//	The macros hould run fine on PC platform and with less ideal graphic on Mac platform too.
//	The display setting of the computer should be 1024 or higher, otherwise the buttons may be unreadable, especially on Macs.
//	Good luck....
