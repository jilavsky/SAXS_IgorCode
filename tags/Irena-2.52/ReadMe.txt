These macros were written to aid our USAXS users in evaluation of small-angle scattering data. The package is, however, written as independent program, useful for evaluation and modeling of small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering in general. 

These macros are written for IgorPro, version 6 (Wavemetrics inc., www.wavemetrics.com). The code should work on both PC and Mac platforms.

What this code should do:
Read the manual, the list is getting too long...

Distribution:
Distributed as zip file or installation Igor experiment.

Both distributions contain same Igor procedures, manual in pdf format and examples... 

For zip file users… You should have one zip file with number of files. The zip file contains the paths, which show where the files belong with respect to "Igor Pro Folder". Placement of the files is important, please, make sure the right files are where indicated. Generally there is one file which belong into the "Igor Procedures" and all other belong into subfolder into the "User Procedures".

Appropriate use:
This code is free for use in open science by anyone. If you would like to use this code for proprietary work, please contact me: ilavsky@aps.anl.gov with respect to permission for the use of these macros.

Warranties:
I make no warranties with respect to functionality of these macros. I will make every attempt to make sure these macros work properly and will attempt to fix any bugs reported to me. I will attempt to provide reasonable support to users of this software. However, I make no guarantees that I will be able to do so...
