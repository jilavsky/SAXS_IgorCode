	<!-- This card was generated by Irena WAXS tool. To edit this card manually, copy card under new name
	Then edit the content. Make sure you rename the material name into unique name type (less than 23 characters!)
	Required content is : 1. either d [A] or Two Theta (TTH) [degrees for Cu wavelength] and Intensity [arbitrary units].
	Note, that d is primary inforamtion, but if d is 0 it is calculated from TTH assuming wavelength of 1.54184A.
	Note, that h k l are very useful. F2 and mult are not useful at this time and can be empty or 0.
	Data distributed with Irena are NOT GUARATEED and are calculated from theoretical models. If you find 
	wrong values or want to add some cards to Irena distribution, please send the data to ilavsky@aps.anl.gov. 
	Keep the structure of this file unchanged or it may not be interpretted correctly by the reader.
