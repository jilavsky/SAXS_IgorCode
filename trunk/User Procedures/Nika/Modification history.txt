Nika package
Code modification history 

-latest stuff first
********************************************
xxxxxx
Modified FITS loader to handle data from different sources, as long as we are looking for sufficiently large 2D image (either in primary or any extension). 
Added small function in Menu which enables to set all paths for Nika to the same place (sample, empty, Calibration, mask…). Can be changed later, but helps to setup easily. 


1.70 10/30/2015
Verified to work on Igor 7 beta 1
Added Configuration manager - allows users to have multiple fully configured “versions” of Nika inside one experiment and switch between them for convenience. Great if you have two different sample-to-detector distances etc. 
File import - modified Pilatus img file loader - sample which contained 4096 bytes header was provided by user, so I added code which checks for the header and if present, skips the header and stores the header in the wave note. Some minor changes to logic of all Pilatus file types, hopefully I did not break anything. 
9ID/15ID normalization SAXS - minor fix. WAXS, well, it is still settling down, not sure what the right numbers are… 

1.69 never released
Major addition - created new calculation of the Q resolution using integration width of pixel (that used to be there), beam size and pixel size. Added beam size controls. If set to 0, ignored. 
Added some warning and better handling when preferences change uncertainty calculation method
9ID/15ID configuration - force SEM as uncertainty method for WAXS and pinSAXS (Pilatus) while Std. Dev for big SAXS (MarCCD). 
Added ability to type in Q distance from center for line profile. Is rounded to nearest full pixel. 


1.68 3/8/2015
Fixed Ag Behenate line 5 which had typo it the d spacing. 
ADSC file format - finish, need dialog, for now added ADSC_A 
Fixed Azimuthal data export ASCII export tool. Bug caused garbage production, data in Igor were correct. 
Renamed Prev. tab into PolTran = Polra transform. Better term for what the procedure does. 
Bug fix - Fixed calculation of one of the angles in GISAXS geometry (alpha-f), which was incorrect. This require adding two options for GISAXS geometries and adding new panel which provides user selection. It also requires extensive description in the manual. Read the manual for description. 
Modified Instrument config for 9IDC USAXS/SAXS/WAXS (should work as well for 15IDD USAXS/SAXS/WAXS) 


1.67 9/15/2014
Mask tool - fix bug which caused the Listbox to be always empty. 


1.66 8/20/2014
Main panel - moved dezinering controls from tab4 to tab2, some users thought that dezinering was available only for Empty/dark and not for sample images… 
Hook functions - added new: ImportedImageHookFunction which can be used to modify any image after load, AfterDisplayImageHook, which modifies detector images displayed by Nika. Fixed PilatusHookFunction. 
Removed some print statements to reduce amount of information in history area. 
Added Cbf file format importer (it has compression, so it was bit more work). 
Added right click menus to most Listboxes, users can now refresh the content and there is also some more functionality where appropriate
Added Pilatus 3, 200k.
Added ability to import 2D calibrated data, for now ASCII (qx qy I dI) from EQSANS and NIST (DAT). 
Added flexible support for CanSAS/Nexus (hdf5 file format). Can export to new or append to existing CanSAS/Nexus file - for now 2D calibrated data. Working on appending 1D data. Can also import a calibrated 2D data set from CanSAS/Nexus file. 
Major new feature - export 2D calibrated data. Either full resolution or pseudo log-q rebinned data. Usable for 2D fitting programs. 
15id support - change sector for pinSAXS & WAXS analysis from 10 to 30 degrees halfwidth. 



1.65 2/20/2014
Fixed minor bug in LP profiles note handling. Matching release for Indra package. 


1.64 1/5/2014
All files - extended copyright to 2005 - 2014
Installer - version 1.23 will handle stale links to hdf5 xops. 
Beam center utils - added many more lines for Lab6, Si, and Ce standards. Modified to disable fitting both SDD and Wavelength, very unlikely this would be possible with most data

1.63 11/23/2013
Added calibration of Intensity popup and “Units=Arbitrary” or “cm2/cm3” or “cm2/g” for Intensity to help Irena to handle calibration of data. 
Attempted to add cbf Pilatus file format, but example data provided by user were incorrect, so code has been disabled again. 

1.62 7/23/2013
Added double click action to other list boxes in Main panel and in Beam center tool
Added *.mccd file format (tif, actually) and combined mpa file formats into the same loader. I am missing "csv" working example so that is not working, but asc, dat, and spe (internal names) are working now. 
Mask tool - Added double click function and offset when Start mask draw is selected to accommodate tools. 

1.61 4/8/2013
Added monthly check for updates and reminder of references for publications.
Modified to compile on computers even without xop and abort & produce message when xop is called with instructions. 
Fixed Pilatus ESRF edf file format. Header was set to 1024 bytes, which is incorrect, it is n*512Bytes. Changed to look for separator and cleaned up the header to match Nika/Irena wave note styles(removed unneeded spaces). 
Modified 15IDD pinSAXS, WAXS support to use new Nexus data, fixed few bugs in calculations. 
Added scroll buttons to enable scrolling of the main panel content for smaller displays. 


1.60 1/4/2013
Added ability to trim name of data in end (default, same as before), in front (new) AND remove from the name string. Needed for some users who cannot be thought that name needs to be at most 20 characters long. 
Fixed error message when processing 15idd pinSAXS data about empty name not matching USAXS empty. Introduced in last update to pinSAXS data processing. 
Fixed bug which caused issues when exporting ASCII from lineprofile. Introduced during converting the export to use free waves.  
Fixed problem when if beam center was way too far from detector the beam center alignment stopped working for higher order lines. 
Added higher order lines to SI standard and updated standards per request. 


1.59 11/5/2012
Fixed Pilatus 300k import bug (wrong dimensions)
Fixed Masking on Preview graph. Software bug introduced few updates ago. 
Fixed minor bug in restore saved settings which caused problem to Image type popup. 
Added three new NIST standards to Beam center & calibration tables

1.58 8/13/2012
Updated manual.
Added ability to "watch" folder with data and automatically display or process latest data set. 
Added SSRL Material Science SAXS support. Tiff file with associated text file of the same name. 
Added double click reaction to the 2D data (samples only). 
GUI fonts control - fixed bug in Windows 7 which caused that fonts were not changed. 
XMLutils xop updated to fix speed in loading xml data files 
Fixed bug in Data selection "cleaning" which removed any file which had as second character "_". 


1.57 5/30/2012
Added support for SSRLMatSAXS instrument. Lookup functions and ability to read their txt file containing records. 
New nika_users mailing list. See: http://www.aps.anl.gov/mailman/listinfo/nika_users for details.
Fix BSL file - wrongly read detector size in pixels for non-square detectors (Pilatus). 
Added small fix to catch debugger in case user creates movie, adds no frames and closes it. 

1.56 4/30/2012
15ID pinSAXS support, fixed the slit length used to create _usx data for merging of 15ID USAXS data with pinSAXS data. 
15ID SAXS support, added various functions to support our large SAXS camera. 
Added option to add colorscale to the main image and to fix range of displayed intensities for the images. Requested features. Seems useful and fun. 
Added more ColorTables as well as option to reverse them. Fit2D is closest to Geo32_R if anyone wants to get close to Fit2D.
Changed Match search to use GrepList - that means it uses now RegEx (regular expressions). Note: ^XYZ means start with XYZ, XYZ matches XYZ anywhere, etc. 

1.55 2/26/2012
Fixed new (2/2012) Nexus file format reading. 

1.54 1/10/2012
Nika now checks what version of Nika tools was used to create Main panel and Beam center panel and if old version is found, it forces users to restart the tool. This should prevent nasty crashes when I update the tools and user opens old Igor experiments.
Added option to generate intensity as function of distance from center in mm. Requested feature apparently useful for calibrations. 
Changed how the loader works. Now the loader will look for files relatively related tho the loader files itself. This should enable in the future having multiple Irena packages installed and be able to switch among them. I am not sure why would any user need to have it, but I need it myself for debugging purposes… 
Modified (Josh actually) BSL file loader to add ability to load different bit order from BSL files. WHy these guys cannot pick one bit order is really big question. 


1.53
Improved Ellipse line profile tool - now outputs also azimuthal angle (as qrs wave starting az_). Saved in ASCII data set as column also. Added as qrs wave type to CntrlPanelTools. 

1.52 11/15/2011
Added support for 15IDD pinSAXS camera. 
Changed behavior. If line profile has all q values negative since it is in direction from 180 degrees to 360 degrees, the q is set to absolute values. Likely what user expects.

1.51 7/29/2011
Changed behavior - DANGEROUS - I tried to catch errors in loading files and skip failed loads. 
Added Pilatus 300k and Pilatus 300k-w per request. 
Added capability to create movies out of either 2D images (RAW/Corrected) or 1D lineouts. Includes ability to use user hook function in case it is needed (advanced users).
Added ability to sort file names in the main listbox by three different methods, including trying to find index number (must be …_001.tif,i.e., preceded by _ and followed by .)
Some changes to Prev graph logic, so it can now use angles from -180 to 540 degrees to enable creating contiguous image which spans 0. Did I mess up something else??? 
Pixel sensitivity … added ability to use mask if present in the system. Also now when Pix2D file is saved, it is also left in the code for use. 
Mask tool - fixed bug which prevented loading existing hdf file mask into the tool. 

1.50 June 17, 2011
Fixed bug in corrections on 2D wave. User found out, that the code was correction in incorrect order. The correction for transmission was done before correcting for dark frame, which was incorrect. Now the transmission correction should be done after correcting the data fro dark frame etc. 
GISAXS part. Modified saving data so when ImagelIneProfile produces points with naN as error (too many masked points in the evaluated area), the error is set to 0. Previously such point was discarded, but some users actually want them.
GISAXS. When saving data along line on detector, they will not be sorted according to value of Q. Is that right thing to do???

1.49 May 31, 2011
Fixed and updated Tilts math. New math and ability to display the diffraction lines deformed by tilting. Seems to work fine and verifies as much as I can check it, but needs more testing. Need input from users… Redesigned a bit the GUI for Beam center and Geometry corrections for easier operations… 
Changed saving Mask - now saved in simple hdf5 file with both image data and mask recreation macro. Therefore you can now edit existing mask by using the mask tool. It is still possible to use old tif masks (_mask.tif) or new masks (_mask.hdf). Old masks cannot be edited. 
Started working on hdf5 loader. This will take some time an detesting and is likely going to require some GYI similar to binary loader since the structure of hdf can be really complex… 
Fixed bug in Pilatus loader which caused error when loading if type was not reselected. 
Added Nexus file loader to support USAXS Pilatus pinhole SAXS. It uses HDf5, but has simpler defined structure so it is easier to read and flatten for Nika. All metadata are stored in the wavenotes. 
BeamCenterUtils  : Fixed bug when BeamCenterUtils gave NaN image when loaded with "Log Image?" checked. Logical error in loading which was reversed by checking and unchecking that checkbox. 
Added more lines for Agbehenate.
Added option to subtract empty field (air blank) loaded through main panel. 
Added ability to fit Gaussian peaks with sloping background and cleaned up the code so when fitting fails for any line out fitting, it should not influence the convergence. 
Removed CursorMovedHook function to avoid conflicts, converted to Window hook functions when necessary

1.48 November 18, 2010
Added ANL license according to other APS products.
Added FITS as input file format. NOTE: this is special version of the FITS file format (which generic definition is in: R. J. Hanisch et al.: FITS standard, Astronomy & Astrophysics 376, 359–380 (2001)). It is likely  going to fail on other files, but it is not clear how this is used in SAXS community at this time. 
Fix for Igor 6.21 new version of TransformAxis1.2.  

1.47 September 1, 2010
updated loader to load mpa/UC files - University of Cincinnati desktop camera.
Fixed problem when selecting Configure GUI fonts without starting other Nika panels. Problem with initialization.
Fixes for Igor 6.20 problems.

1.44 3/3/2010
fixed bug in adding Q scale to images which caused issues when used with InvertImages checkbox. 
Added match strings for same and empty/dark names so one can navigate better through large datasets. Use with * if needed. … not yet in the manual. 

1.43  2/23/2010
Added ability to display CCD image (just the main image) with Qx/Qy or Qy/QZ axes instead of pixels. It is bit cumbersome but should be transparent to users. 
Updated ADSC file reader per request from PReichert@lbl.gov. It is modified to read I0 and other parameters from their file header. 
Changed uncertainity estimates - now can use "old method" (which has bug in formula), Standard Deviation, or Standard error of mean. User choice through GUI (Configuration panel) and added chapter in the manual. 
Added Pilatus loader (again, request from  PReichert@lbl.gov). For now can do tif, float-tiff, img or edf 100k, 1M, and 2M files. Need to test as not all formats were available. Also, currently the headers are loaded and included in wave note, but not used. Compressed tiff files are niot supported. Float-tiff not tested at all. Code added based on matlab code downloaded from somewhere...  
Changed BinaryFileLoader - added option for Low/high byte first for Floats. ESRF edf file is low-byte-first and that could not be read.
Added specialized loader for ESRF edf file, but tested on only one file. Therefore performance is not guaranteed.  

1.42 
Added Solid Angle correction. If selected, data are divided also by solid angle opening (PixelSizeX/SDD * PixelSizeY/SDD). Needs to be used correctly with appropriate Calibration factor. Added to the first tab and to the correction formula. This was requested by someone actually using same detector in different distances. 
Checked and verified Geometrical correction - Divides intensity by cos(2Theta)^3. Took me long time to figure out, but one cos(2theta) is from change in radial pixel size, one is from change in SDD for radial direction and one is from change in SDD for tangential direction. This is correct geometrical correction for change in Solid angle with scattering angle. 
Finished (except for finding all new bugs) the line profile tool - now can do three lines (horizontal, vertical and angle), two GI_SAXS line types (horizontal and vertical, calculates Qx, Qy, Qz) and also ellipse. Can be extended if needed. 
****NOTE: there is a lot of space for optimization if this takes too long to calculate. But it is really spaghetti code by now and needs to be recast with bit more stringent logic before that can be done. ****
Fixed old link in the "About" box to UNICAT web site,which does not exist any more. 
All corrections (geometry correction and polarization correction) are now done to 2D data, so intensity read from Processed image should be fully corrected. 
Another iteration of DND CAT support. Added ability to read data from new log version (1.10) and added corrections for Empty beam data so they should be now scaled properly for subtraction. 

1.41beta
Added (beta) horizontal and vertical line profiles as reduction for GI SAXS support. Needs to be finsihed, but should work by now. 
Enable display of processed (calibrated) image or raw image (NIka was always displaying ONLY raw). Modify the code to store and export the image properly. 
Change of behavior - since user may want to process image only to see processed image, it will now be possible and only warning that nothing is saved (unless user actually does it on his/her own) is printed in history area. 
Fix GUI issue when Monitor I0 appeared even when they were not needed and confused smarter users.  
Change in DND support. Will work bit more on this, but hopefully fixed the mess with transmission and calibration constant.
Fix GetFit2dLocation function on Windows, which seemed not to work in 6.10. I wonder when the change happen?
Changed polarization correction to be available in 2D. 1D is still there... 

1.31
Update for 6.10 - changed way Concatenate is called to avoid error in 6.10 in beam center utilities. 
Added DND CAT support. 


1.30
Fixed file loaders. Missing reference to wave after GBLoadWave caused error. Did Igor Pro change behavior here? It was not necessary in previous versions of Igor?
Added Panels font control tool. Same logic as Irena. 
Removed all panels and windows from Igor menus. 
Added LaB6 as standard with predefined d spacings
Changed display to shows only .img files when ADSC type selected. Supposedly this is the right choice. 

1.20
Added loader for ibw (Igor binary) data. Note: This file contains wave name and it is possible bad things happen if the wave name is conflicting with important wave in Igor experiment. 
Added (and tested) option export of GSAS type data (user request) when two-theta data are produced. 
Added reader for BSL data type. Can read both SAXS and WAXS data images.
Added reader for Fuji image plate reader (BAS2000 and BAS2500). For now only 8 bit data sets is tested, need test data to debug 16 bit data sets. 16 bits should work, if I got it right. 
Finally fixed the Rigaku Raxis file format - may be... Anyway, now it should manage any size Rigaku files and should not fail. Solution from 1.18 was wrong. 

1.19 
Added reader for ASCII matrix with custom load option for .mtx and .prm files from user instrument. Usable for any ASCII matrix, but for this special case will pull out some parameters from the prm file and stuff everything in the wave note, so user can find it there. 

1.18 September 15. 2007
Changed Rigaku loader format - yet another size of images found with different offset. Now I search for the first non-zero byte after the header to find the right offset. Hopefully this will work. 
ADSC loader - added wavelength and energy to be loaded from the header. 
Added loader for WinView (Princeton CCD) .spe file format (using code by Jon Tischler).
Added ability to use Fit2d on Mac as file loader. Download Mac version of Fit2d, install (chmod +x it so it can be run). Due to limitations the temp tiff file will be created in data file area. 

1.17 July 15, 2007
Fixed bug which reset q-binning to logarithmic any time main panel was opened. Should not force users to sensible things this much :-)
Fixed call to open pdf manual to manage when procedures are not in default place. 
Added ADSC loader provided by Alexander Hexemer, Lbnl. Tested with his images.  
Fixed bug in Geom corrections which returned needless error for missing wave. 

1.16 4/11.2007
Previous release broke Igor 5 functionality... This should fix it - there was bug which made it backwards incompatible. 

1.15 3/29/2007   Fix to make compatible with Igor 6.0 
Fixed code for many popup controls, as it was still failing in Igor 6. Should be fixed now. Tested what I could find in Igor 6.01beta11. 
Fixed one bug in Make mask, where the slider ranges were not set correctly on load of new file 
Fixed Bug when wrong extension for flood image was called. The file is always tiff (created by Nika package) but was called with extension of user data.



1.14 2/28/2007
Fixed to make compatible with Igor 6.0 (=== wrong, still were some bugs left)
Modified path to store temp data to system temp directory, so the user can run even when he/she is measly no-permission user, who cannot write in Igor folder. 
Added option to modify imported image by user defined hook function... If this function does not exist, it is not run and all behaves as previously... User can create function which has one parameter (wave) and modifies the same wave. The name has to be as exactly : ModifyImportedImageHook. Example follows:
//******************************************************
function ModifyImportedImageHook(waveToModify)
	wave waveToModify

	string OldDf=GetDataFOlder(1)
	setDataFOlder root:Packages:Convert2Dto1D

	//modify the wave here somehow...
	//this example cuts out of large image only 300 x 300 points...
	Make/O/S/N=(300,300) temp2Dwave		//make new destination wave, 300 x 300 points
	temp2Dwave = waveToModify[920+p][875+q]	//fill this wave with part of image we want to use
	string namWv=nameOfWave(waveToModify)	//find the name of the original wave
	Duplicate/O temp2Dwave, $namWv		//overwrite the original wave with the new one

	//end of user wave modifications... 
	setDataFolder OldDf
end
//******************************************************
This function is run for all imports, except for mask, as that is special created wave. All others will be passed through this function - that includes data import, import of dark and empty and of waves for beam center and mask creation. User needs to make this function inaccessible (rename it), if it should not be run...



1.13 (7/1/2006)
Added separate checkbox for solid angle correction AND polarization correction. Fixed Solid angle correction (it should be 1/cos(angle)^3, matches NIST routines and Fit2D). Placed in routines to be done with 2D data (just after all calibration steps)... Fixed routine NI1A_SolidangleCorrection and added new routine NI1A_GenerateGeometryCorr2DWave. Need to fix the polarization correction routine. That still makes very little sense to me...   
Fixed loader for Rigaku, so it should work on both Max and PCs... Weird, the binary file has Mac-like bit order...

1.12
Requested feature: Added into "Make mask" tool the capability to automatically mask off points with really low intensity. Useful for detectors which have circular active area, so points in corners are set to 0 intensity. 
Added built in loader for Rigaku R-axis data format. The format header contains a lot of principally useful info. Some of it is parsed to the rest of the code (number of points, wavelength, pizel size in mm). All of it is saved in the wave note of the image. Note: Beam center is not parsed, as I am worried that it would overwrite any fitted values user may have. 

1.11
Bug fix - save configuration did not work right (bug introduced in previous versions)... Included at the same time sync for most of popupmenus and listboxes. I wonder what else I am forgetting about. 
Added Ag Behenate second line in known calibrants.

1.10
Tilts reworked and should work now... It is very difficult to verify the proper functionality. Need some real test case with known tilts (and significant)... 
Added fix to fileLoaders to load standard tiff files, which load as 3 layer files (24 bit tiff). Still for B/W images ONLY, dumps the other dimensions... 

1.09
Added option to save image within Igor experiment - can create VERY large files (some images may be 40 Mb large or even more in double precision...)
Added some support (create image, delete saved images, changing the color table and range) for saved images. 
Fixed bug which tripped debugger when nofile existed in selected external image data folder
Added option to skip files witgh no intensity in them. 
Added mpa/asc ascii type of data for Molecular Metrology SAXS system at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville data type. ASCII header, two lineout blocks and the ASCII 2d data. Takes forever to load... 
Start workign on tilts, but these are at this time removed from GUIs

1.08
Added option to process N images at time. It is now possible to select many files and process them in pair,triplets etc...

1.07 
Fixed bug in Q vector creation which resulted in wrong values for wide angle scattering
Fixed bug which resulted n recalcualtion every time of the LUTs.

1.06
Fixed bug which prevented use of mask in beam center tool
Fixed bug in caluclating distances in Beam center tool which caused failure at higher angles.
Added check for existencee of Fit2D program.
Beam center tool - added some new features.
Added check for existence of path when saving config file

1.05 February 16,2005
Fixed geometry correction which in version 1.04 was wrongly implemented... At this time I think it is right...  

1.04 February 15,2005
Added geometry corrections to beam center tool, added manual control for help circle radius.
Hopefully fixed problem with mask in the beam center tool, which caused misbehavior of the tool. 


1.03 February 13 2005
Fixed bug checking if LUT waves need to be recalculated causing recalculation all the time... Rounding error in comparing parameters. 

1.02  February 12 2005
Added beam center and calibrant alignement tools. Still in development...
Added option to have "natural" number of bins - this is equivalent to have linear bins in Q with width of 1 pixel. 

1.01 January 13
Fixed GeneralBinary loader bug, the byte order was fixed at high byte first due to typo in the code.
Added basic beam center tool (fitting of 2D gaussian to attnuated beam). Created GUI where to add rest of the stuff... 


January 6 2005, version 1.0
inital release
